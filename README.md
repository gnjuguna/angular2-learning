* Best practices in file and application organization for Angular 2.
* Ready to go build system using Webpack for working with TypeScript.
* Angular 2 examples that are ready to go when experimenting with Angular 2.
* A great Angular 2 seed repo for anyone who wants to start their project.
* Testing Angular 2 code with Jasmine and Karma.
* Coverage with Istanbul and Karma
* End-to-end Angular 2 code using Protractor.

```coffeescript
Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.1.x`+ and NPM `2.14.x`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typings` (`npm install --global typings`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `typings install` to install necessary typings
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
npm run server # or either webpack-dev-server
```

## Other commands

### build files
```bash
npm run build
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch
```

### run tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver-start
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# make sure you have webdriver running and a sever for the client app
npm run e2e
```

# Contributing
You can include more examples as components but they must introduce a new concept such as `Home` component (separate folders), and Todo (services). I'll accept pretty much everything so feel free to open a Pull-Request

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 1.7.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```
